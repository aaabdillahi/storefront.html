          <h3> Concept of Responsive design </h3>
          <p>Responsive Web design shouldn't be just about how to create a flexible layout on a wide range of platforms and screen sizes.<br>
            The white space around the content on larger screens is also more spacious and interesting, whereas it is simplified for practical purposes on smaller screens.<br><br>
            Whereas on a wider screen we'd look left to right, on a narrower screen we'd tend to look from top to bottom.<br>
            On a smaller screen, the portfolio piece is cut down to one, and then eventually left out altogether for very small screens and narrow browsers.<br>
            This design has three main stages at which the design and layout collapse into a more user-friendly form, depending on how wide the screen or browser is.<br><br>
            As a result of the design style, on screens that are too small, the background image gets mostly hidden and the content can become illegible and squished.<br>
            Understanding how to make a design responsive to the user doesn't require too much learning, and it can definitely be a lot less stressful and more productive than learning how to design and code properly for every single device available.<br>         
            </p>

            <p>
               Using this line will allow our browsers to control the page's dimensions and scaling <br>
               <b>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</b><br><br>
               In the CSS file, we used a <b>@media</b>query. Within in we set the <b>(max-width: 620px)</b>. <br>
               This means that if a device with a width of less than 620px, it will be rendered as mobile device format.<br>
               It will be rendered to mobile by using this line within your CSS file <b>(width: 100%)</b> This will tell the viewport
               that the width will be 100% when the size is 620px or smaller.<br>
